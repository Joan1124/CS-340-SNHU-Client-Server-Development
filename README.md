# CS-340-SNHU-Client-Server-Development

In this project we created a CRUD python module in project one, which we later used to connect dashboard widgets to our database in our second project. Creating a reusable python code made our development for project two considerably easier and faster. We could use this python module in the future to interact with our database in any other program. 

My approach to problems as computer scientist is to first understand the problem, understand well what's the desired outcome and then try to find a solution. I find that taking a step back to think before acting usually leads to finding a solution faster and more efficient.
